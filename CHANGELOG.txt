0.9.3: Fixed readyState bug in finally clause in XMLDocument.prototype.load.
         Added var before for loop indexes.
 
0.9.2: Sarissa was "adversely affecting Array". Now, Sarissa uses the  new 
        SarissaNodeList class that inherits Array, instead of extending Array
        directly. Many thanks to Rob (Flaherty?) for the bug report and initial patch.

0.9.xx  No changelog kept.
