0.9.4  NOTE: Deprecated stuff will go away in 0.9.6. You 
       have been warned. 
       * Added some constants to check for availability of features. 
       * the xml property is now deprecated. 
       * transformNode and transformNodeToObject are deprecated
       * Sarissa.setXslParameter is now deprecated.
       * Sarissa now has the getXmlString method that replaces IE's .xml property,
          which is now deprecated.
       * Sarissa's getXmlString,getXmlHttpRequest and getDomDocument should 
          work on KHTML-based browsers like Konqueror (at least on my KDE 3.3) 
          and Safari.
       * First stab at sarissa_dhtml.js, dont know if that will stay there...
       
0.9.3: Fixed readyState bug in finally clause in XMLDocument.prototype.load.
         Added var before for loop indexes.
 
0.9.2: Sarissa was "adversely affecting Array". Now, Sarissa uses the  new 
        SarissaNodeList class that inherits Array, instead of extending Array
        directly. Many thanks to Rob (Flaherty?) for the bug report and initial patch.

0.9.xx  No changelog kept.
