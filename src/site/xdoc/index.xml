            <p> Sarissa is an ECMAScript library acting as a cross-browser wrapper for native XML
                APIs. It offers various XML related goodies like Document instantiation, XML loading
                from URLs or strings, XSLT transformations, XPath queries etc and comes especially
                handy for people doing what is lately known as "AJAX" development. </p>
            <p> Supported browsers are Mozilla - Firefox and family, Internet Explorer with MSXML3.0
                and up, Konqueror (KDE 3.3+ for sure), Safari and Opera. Konq and Safari offer no
                XSLT/XPath scripting support AFAIK. </p>
            <p> For a HOWTO document that provides examples of common tasks see the <a
                    href="howtos.html">HOWTOs</a>. <b>The API documentation follows (thanks to <a

            <p> Sarissa is documented with <a href="http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net"
                    title="Link to JSDoc project at SourceForge">JSDoc</a>, tested with <a
                    href="http://kupu.oscom.org/download/">ECMAUnit</a>. The documentation and
                distribution are build with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Maven</a> and <a
                    href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> respectively. In the Ant build file
                Sarissa scripts are also checked using some custom code and <a
                    href="http://www.JSLint.com">JSLint</a> (comes with a really cool license). If
                you want to use JSLint in your ant builds you might want to check out build.xml from
                CVS and head for the <code>jslint</code> target. </p>
            <p> Sarissa was inspired by articles and code available on the web, most notably the <a
                    href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/ieemu/">IE Emu Series</a> [webfx.eae.net] at
                webfx and <a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/domwrapper/"
                    >Cross-Browser DOM Wrapper article</a> [webreference.com]. </p>
            <p>Here are some projects using Sarissa, please let me know if you want yours included
                here. This is in the credits because, simply, if Sarissa was not usefull i would
                stop working on it. Currently Sarissa has been downloaded more than 45000 times so i
                guess i will be maintaining it for a while :-)</p>
