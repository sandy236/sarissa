        <section name="Overview">
            <p> Sarissa is an ECMAScript library acting as a cross-browser wrapper for native XML
                APIs. It offers various XML related goodies like Document instantiation, XML loading
                from URLs or strings, XSLT transformations, XPath queries etc and comes especially
                handy for people doing what is lately known as "AJAX" development. </p>
            <p> Supported browsers are Mozilla - Firefox and family, Internet Explorer with MSXML3.0
                and up, Konqueror (KDE 3.3+ for sure), Safari and Opera. Konq and Safari offer no
                XSLT/XPath scripting support AFAIK. </p>
            <p> For a HOWTO document that provides examples of common tasks see the <a
                    href="./howtos.html">HOWTOs</a>. The API documentation is generated using <a
                    href="http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net" title="Link to JSDoc project at SourceForge"

            <p> The latest version of Sarissa can always be found on <a

            <p> Sarissa is documented with <a href="http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net"
                    title="Link to JSDoc project at SourceForge">JSDoc</a> and <a
                    href="./test/testsarissa.html">tested</a> with <a
                    href="http://kupu.oscom.org/download/">ECMAUnit</a>. This site, as well as the   
                distribution package, is build with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Maven</a> and <a
                    href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>. The compressed versions 
                    of the Sarissa scripts are created using the 
                <a href="http://www.mobilvox.com/projects/maven-js-plugin/">MobilVox Maven JavaScript Plugin</a>. 
                In the Ant build file Sarissa scripts are also checked using some custom code and <a
                    href="http://www.JSLint.com">JSLint</a> (comes with a really cool license). If
                you want to use JSLint in your Ant builds you might want to check out build.xml from
                CVS and head for the <code>jslint</code> target. The syntax highlighting in 
                the documentation uses the 
                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">Syntaxhighlighter</a></p>
            <p> Sarissa was inspired by articles and code available on the web, most notably the <a
                    href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/ieemu/">IE Emu Series</a> [webfx.eae.net] at
                webfx and <a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/domwrapper/"
                    >Cross-Browser DOM Wrapper article</a> [webreference.com]. </p>
            <p>Here are some projects using Sarissa, please let us know if you would like to add yours 
                here. This is in the credits simply because if Sarissa was not usefull we would not be 
                working on it. Currently Sarissa has been downloaded more than 54k times so we
                will be maintaining it for some time :-)</p>
