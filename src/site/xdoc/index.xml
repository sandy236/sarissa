        <section name="Overview">
            <p> Sarissa is an ECMAScript library acting as a cross-browser wrapper for native XML
                APIs. It offers various XML related goodies like Document instantiation, XML loading
                from URLs or strings, XSLT transformations, XPath queries etc and comes especially
                handy for people doing what is lately known as "AJAX" development. </p>
            <p> Supported browsers are Mozilla - Firefox and family, Internet Explorer with MSXML3.0
                and up, Konqueror (KDE 3.3+ for sure), Safari and Opera. Konq and Safari offer no
                XSLT/XPath scripting support AFAIK. </p>
            <p> For a HOWTO document that provides examples of common tasks see the <a
                    href="./howtos.html">HOWTOs</a>. The API documentation is generated using <a

            <p>Projects used when developing Sarissa:</p>

            <p>Here are some projects using Sarissa, please let us know if you would like to add yours 
                here. This is in the credits simply because if Sarissa was not usefull we would not be 
                working on it. Currently Sarissa has been downloaded more than 56k times so we
                will be maintaining it for some time :-)</p>
